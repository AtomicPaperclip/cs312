Linux Basics (Day 3)
====================

Filesystems, system booting and OS Installation

Before we begin
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo yum install man man-pages man-pages-overrides
  $ man hier # a massive man page explaining the filesystem hierarchy

.. code-block:: bash

  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:\
  /home/centos/bin

``$PATH`` is used as a colon-delimited list of places to look for binaries by
your shell

.. code-block:: bash

  $ which pwd
  /bin/pwd

The ``which`` command tells you which binary it is running for a given name.

Special File permissions
------------------------

* Sticky bit
* setuid
* setgid
* Security

Filesystem
==========

The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
------------------------------

What's a filesystem?

    *In computing, a file system is used to control how information is stored and
    retrieved. Without a file system, information placed in a storage area would
    be one large body of information with no way to tell where one piece of
    information stops and the next begins.*

    -- (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem)

Filesystem can mean:
--------------------

- **How the system's files are arranged on the disk**
- How the disk actually holds the files

  - FAT and NTFS are old but Windows-compatible
  - ext4 is standard, ext3 is older, xfs is being used less

    - journaling tracks changes before write

  - ZFS is awesome, but has meh Linux support (but getting better)
  - btrfs is similar to ZFS, but less mature
  - sysadmins will encounter NFS and its competitors like Gluster

.. note::
  Moving from Windows?

  - Binaries, not executables.
  - Directories, not folders.
  - Read, not load.
  - Symbolic links, not shortcuts.
  - Write, not save.

The File System
---------------

.. figure:: ../_static/you_are_here.jpg
    :align: center
    :scale: 75%

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ls /
  bin     dev   lib         media  proc  sbin     sys  var
  boot    etc   lib64       mnt    root  selinux  tmp
  cgroup  home  lost+found  opt    run   srv      usr

\/bin & \/sbin
--------------

* Store binaries that are used to boot system and mount other fileystems
* binaries for all users in ``/bin``, binaries used by root are in ``/sbin``
* Things like ``mount``, ``echo``, ``chmod``, ``hostname``

\/usr (Historical Context)
--------------------------

People were running out of disk space so:

* All binaries not required for base system + booting + mounting other
  devices went in ``/usr/bin`` and ``/usr/sbin``
* These binaries were typically manually compiled and installed by the user
* Eventually some unices (linux didn't exist yet) took over
  ``/usr/bin`` and ``/usr/sbin`` for the location that packages were
  installed to.
* Now manually installed (without package manager) binaries go in
  ``/usr/local/bin`` and ``/usr/local/sbin``.

\/usr (Modern Context)
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ls /usr
  bin  games    lib    libexec  sbin   src
  etc  include  lib64  local    share  tmp

.. csv-table::
  :header: Location, Description

  /usr/bin,Packages installed by package manager
  /usr/sbin,Packages installed by package manager
  /usr/etc,Rarely used; files from /etc can be symlinked here
  /usr/games,Binaries for games and educational programs

\/usr (Modern Context)
----------------------

.. csv-table::
  :header: Location, Description

  /usr/include,Include files for the C compiler
  /usr/lib,Object libraries (including dynamic libs); some unusual binaries
  /usr/lib64,64-bit libraries
  /usr/libexec,Executables used with libraries; not used much
  /usr/local,Programs (and their configuration) locally installed by user go here

\/usr (Modern Context)
----------------------

.. csv-table::
  :header: Location, Description

  /usr/share,Application data; typically examples and documentation
  /usr/src/linux,Kernel source goes here

\/dev
-----

* Device files, which often refer to physical devices

  * ``/dev/sd?``
  * ``/dev/sr?``
  * ``/dev/tty*``

* Special character devices:

  * ``/dev/null`` -- sink for writes
  * ``/dev/random`` -- high quality randomness (blocking)
  * ``/dev/urandom`` -- non-blocking random
  * ``/dev/zero`` -- always reads 0s

\/etc
-----

* Configuration files local to the machine
* Programs almost always look here for configuration first

\/home
------

* Contains homedirs of regular users
* Sometimes symlinked to ``/usr/home``, but rarely on linux

\/lib & \/lib64
---------------

* Libraries needed to boot and run commands related to bootstrapping

\/media & \/mnt
---------------

* Used as mount points for other devices (usb sticks, nfs, etc)
* Most Desktop Environments automatically mount things to ``/media``

\/proc
------

* Special filesystem ``procfs`` contains a file-representation of
  the current state of the kernel and running processes.

\/sys
-----

* File-representation of device drivers, subsystems, and hardware
  loaded into the kernel
* Similar to ``sysctl`` on other Unixy systems

\/var
-----

* Multi-purpose: log, temporary, transient, and spool files
* Typically contains run-time data
* Cache

Devices
-------

* TODO

User-Specific Data & Configuration
----------------------------------

* Data stored at ``/home/<username>``
  * Desktop environment creates folders Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc.
* Configurations in dotfiles within home (``/.``)

* ``lost+found`` is **not** your desktop trash can

  * Lost blocks of the filesystem.
  * Usually not an issue.
  * If your desktop provides backups of deleted files, they'll be somewhere
    in ``/home/<username>/``

Space on drives
---------------

Use ``df`` to see disk free space.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ df -h /
  Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sda8        73G   29G   41G  42% /

Use ``du`` to see disk usage.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ du -sh /home/
    21G /home/

Default output is in bytes, ``-h`` for human-readable output.

Commands for working with filesystems
-------------------------------------

Creating filesystems

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkfs

Mounting filesystems

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mount
  # -t for type
  # -o for options
  # requires device path and mount point

Loopback devices

.. code-block:: bash

  $ losetup
  $ /dev/loop*

devfs
-----

.. code-block:: bash

  /dev/sd*
  /dev/sr*
  /dev/null
  /dev/random
  /dev/urandom
  /dev/zero

Blocks and dd
-------------

* Block size is the size of chunks allocated for files

* dd

  * Disk duplicator (or disk dump).

    * ``if=<path>`` -- input file.
    * ``of=<path>`` -- ooutput file.
    * ``bs=<size>`` -- block size.
    * ``count=<size>`` -- number of block to transfer.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda
  # What will this do?

Filesystem Consistency
----------------------

* Metadata vs. data

  * Metadata is extra information the filesystem tracks about the file
  * Data is the file's contents

* Filesystem is **consistent** if all metadata is intact

  * ``fsck`` is FileSystem Consistency Check

More about Journaling
---------------------

- Filesystem consistency tool; protections against system freezes, power
  outages, etc.
- Replaying the journal.
- ext4â€™s three modes of journaling:

  - :journal: Data and metadata to journal.
  - :ordered: Data updates to filesystem, then metadata committed to journal.
  - :writeback: Metadata comitted to journal, possibly before data updates.

- ext4 journaling differs from ext3 because it uses a single-phase
  checksum transaction, allowing it to be done asynchronously.

Booting
=======

Boot steps
----------

* POST
* Bootloader
* Kernel
* [Ramdisk] -- initrd
* init
* Everything else

POST
----

* Power On Self Test
* BIOS
* Initializes hardware at very low level

  * ensures it is accessible
  * does **not** load drivers

Bootloader
----------

* Responsible for booting the kernel
* Contained in first 512 bytes (MBR scheme)
* Can chainload to another bootloader

Bootloader
----------

* Most linux-based systems use GRUB

  * GRand Unified Bootloader

* LILO (LInux LOader) is an uncommon alternative
* syslinux, isolinux are often used for usb/cd images

GRUB
----

* Version 2 vs 0.97 (and 0.98)
* 2 is more complex, but does more
* 0.97/8 is simple and easy to use

GRUB Configuration
------------------

* CentOS 6 (your VMs) use GRUB 0.97
* Main configuration is in ``/boot/grub/menu.lst``
* kernels and initrds live in ``/boot``

::

  default=0
  timeout=0
  splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz

    initrd /boot/initramfs-2.6.32-504.3.3.el6.x86_64.img

GRUB Configuration
------------------

* ``root`` -- boot partition
* ``kernel`` -- your linux kernel!
* ``initrd`` -- initial ram disk which is mounted to help you boot

initrd
------

* Initial Ram Disk
* Ram disk contains enough to mount ``/``
* runs ``/init`` on the ramdisk (before mounting the **real** ``/``)
  , which mounts ``/`` and runs the new init:

.. code-block:: bash

   for f in /mount/*.sh; do
     [ -f "$f" ] && . "$f"
     [ -d "$NEWROOT/proc" ] && break;
   done
   ...
   exec switch_root "$NEWROOT" "$INIT" $initargs

* mostly necessary if you are using ``lvm``, ``cryptsetup (LUKS)``, or other
  complex configurations

real init
---------

* PID 1 (because it is the first thing that runs!)
* Ancestor to every other process
* Runs all other startup scripts (networking, etc)
* Most linuces are settling on ``systemd`` as their init system

  * alternatives: systemv, openrc, bsd-style, upstart
  * your Centos 6 VM uses upstart, Centos 7 uses systemd
